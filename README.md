# ETG-Inventory-Management-System-Project-
This repository based on inventory management system which consists of jason files done during Skill India Python/AI internship

I have made an inventory management system which works on NOSQL based database.
In this project Customer can purchase products and generate bills.
A simple inventory management system is built with json files.

#Steps to use
1.Customer can enter the product ID and quantity of the product they want to purchase.
2.After entering the details, they can purchase products and bill will be generated with total billing amount. 

We can generate 5 features per each product
 1.Product ID
 2.Name of the product
 3.Amount
 4.Quantity
 5.Expiry date
 6.Billing Amount

Things that can be done in my project
    1.Add new items to inventory
    2.Customer can purchase products
    3.Generate bills
    4.Update inventory
    5.View Transaction History
    
There are more than 30 products in the inventory.
I have created two jason files in this project:
   1.record.json file is used to see the product details and
   2.sales.json file is used to see transaction history.
